    "text": "The Kaya Identity is a simple model for observing Earth’s anthropogenic system macroscopically.1\n\\[\nF=  P \\cdot \\frac {G}{P} \\cdot \\frac{E}{G} \\cdot \\frac {F}{E}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nF = CO2 emissions from human sources\nP = global population\nG = Gross Domestic Produc\nE = global energy consumption\n\nAnd:\n\nG/P = per capita GDP\nE/G is the energy intensity of the GDP\nF/E is the emission intensity of energy\n\nA mathematical identity is an equality where both sides of an equation are identical in value. It allows us to slowly peel the onion on one side of the equation.\nThis identical nature becomes evident as P, E, G will cancel themselves out, leaving us simple with:\n\\[\nWealth=  Population \\cdot \\frac {G.D.P}{Population} \\cdot \\frac{E}{G}\n\\]\nBut, it becomes easier to read when the constituent parts are more explicit. Hence the following is identical:\n\\[\n{\\displaystyle CO_2=Population\\cdot {\\frac {GDP}{Population}}\\cdot {\\frac {EnergyUse}{GDP}}\\cdot {\\frac {CO_2}{EnergyUse}}}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_2 = Population \\cdot\\frac{CO_2}{Energy} \\cdot\\frac{Energy}{GDP}\n\\cdot\\frac{GDP}{Population}\n\\cdot\\frac{Population} {GDP}\n\\]\nThe first observation is that we live in a delicate balance with a burning ball of fire next to us. The surface of the earth is reflective, and sends the sun’s energy back into space. But with amount of Carbon in the air prevents\n\\[\nCO_2 = CO_2\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_2 = P\\cdot\\frac{CO_2}{E}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{ CO2 emissions = Carbon content of energy × Energy intensity of the economy × Production per person × Population}\n\\]\nThe largest Carbon Credits ETF is the KraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF KRBN with $557.92M in assets. In the last trailing year, the best-performing Carbon Credits ETF was KCCA at 12.52%. The most recent ETF launched in the Carbon Credits space was the Global X Carbon Credits Strategy ETF NTRL on 05/24/23.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nLoading required package: PerformanceAnalytics\n\nLoading required package: xts\n\nLoading required package: zoo\n\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n\n\n\n######################### Warning from 'xts' package ##########################\n#                                                                             #\n# The dplyr lag() function breaks how base R's lag() function is supposed to  #\n# work, which breaks lag(my_xts).

    "text": "Heat Predictions\nPlaying in the heat is tough, especially as players age. Do we need to adapt, or is there nothing to worry about? The City of Ottawa provides climate prediction data; this article tries to model some of the potential medium term effects.\n\n\nOttawa Data Sets\nNetCDF is a data format climate data, and has also been adopted in other fields, particularly in bioinformatics, and in other disciplines where large multidimensional arrays of data are generated. Unlike most data formats, NetCDF files contain metadata that describes what is contained in a file, such as the latitude and longitude layout of the grid, the names and units of variables in the data set, and “attributes” that describe things like missing value codes, or offsets and scale factors that may have been used to compress the data. NetCDF files are also machine-independent because can be transferred among servers and computers that are running different operating systems, without having to convert the files in some way. Originally developed for storing and distributing climate data, such as those generated by climate simulation or reanalysis models, the format and protocols can be used for other gridded data sets. NetCDF libraries are developed and maintained by Unidata http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ and easy-to-use applications for producing simple visualizations of NetCDF files exist, such as Panoply, http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/.\nThere are two versions of netCDF; netCDF3, which is widely used, but has some size and performance limitations, and netCDF4, which supports larger data sets and includes additional capabilities like file compression.\nR has the capability of reading and writing (and hence analyzing) netCDF files, using the ncdf and ncdf4 packages provided by David Pierce, and through other packages like raster, metR1, and RNetCDF. The ncdf4.helpers and easyNCDF packages provide some additional tools.\nLoad the ncdf4 package.\n# load the ncdf4 package\nlibrary(ncdf4)\nThe file is assumed to be a CF-compliant netCDF file, in which the three main spatiotemporal dimensions allear the the relative order of time (T-coordinate), height or depth (Z-coordinate), latitude (or Y-coordinate), and longitude (or X-coordinate). In this example, the file is a 3-D file with T, Y and X coordinates (month of the year, latitude, and longitude). First, set the values for some temporary variables. ncpath is the path to where the file was downloaded, ncname is the name of the netCDF file, while dname is the name of the variable that will be read in.\nOpen the NetCDF file\n# set path and filename\nncpath &lt;- \"./data/nc_files/\"\nncname &lt;- \"cru10min30_tmp\"  \nncfname &lt;- paste(ncpath, ncname, \".nc\", sep=\"\")\ndname &lt;- \"tmp\"  # note: tmp means temperature (not temporary)\nOpen the NetCDF data set, and print some basic information. The print() function applied to the ncin object produces information similar to that produced by the command-line utility ncdump.\n# open a netCDF file\nncin &lt;- nc_open(ncfname)\nprint(ncin)"
